            <h2>Institutions</h2>
            <p class="intro">Each region has an elected parliament, called <em>Consiglio Regionale</em> (regional council), or <em>Assemblea Regionale</em> (regional assembly) in Sicily, and a government called <em>Giunta Regionale</em> (regional committee), headed by a governor called Presidente della Giunta Regionale (president of the regional committee) or Presidente della Regione (regional president). The latter is directly elected by the citizens of each region, with the exceptions of Aosta Valley and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regions where the president is chosen by the regional council.
            Under the 1995 electoral law, the winning coalition receives an absolute majority of seats on the council. The president chairs the giunta, and nominates or dismisses its members, called <strong>assessori</strong>. If the directly elected president resigns, new elections are called immediately.</p>

            <h2>Representation in the Senate</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">57 of the Constitution of Italy originally established that the</span> <span class="accent-color">Senate of the Republic was to be elected on a regional basis by Italian citizens aged 25 or older</span> (unlike the Chamber of the Deputies, which was elected on a national basis and by all Italian citizens aged 18 or older). No region could have less than 7 senators, except for the two smallest regions: Aosta Valley (1 senator) and Molise (2 senators). From 2006 to 2020, 6 out of 315 senators (and 12 out of 630 deputies) were elected by Italians residing abroad.</p>
